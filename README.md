# BatCrowd's Detector
A multi-functional and multi-use bat detector. The BatCrowd Detector aims to reduce the costs incurred to monitor and identify bat species while not significantly comprimsing on quality when compared to commerical bat detectors.
<br>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Ultrasonic recording</li>
  <li>Sound-activated recording</li>
  <li>Spectogram display</li>
  <li>Time Expansion Playback</li>
  <li>Heterodyne Playback</li>
  <li>Automatically uploads to BatIdentification.com</li>
</ul>
  
These files are all time-stamped without the use of a RTC (Real-time clock) module by having client devices send the time to the BatPi. The detector can use either a GPS module or a client's GPS module to add geolocation to bat call entries in the database.

<h2>Setting up</h2>

The code included in this repository is for the BatCrowd Detector's webinterface. To setup everything and download the software you can download our script from:

<h3>The future</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Show the current power remaining on the detector</li>
  <li>Improving the speed of the web-interface</li>
  <li>Having a combined spectrogram and time-expansion viewer</li>
  <li>Have the BatPi do the spectrograms and Time Expansion in advance of wanting a file to be played</li>
</ul>
